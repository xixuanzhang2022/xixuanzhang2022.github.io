Together with my co-authors, I developed a **structure-aware embedding space** to capture how online discourse forms and unfolds over time. We encoded interactions among key discourse characteristics — **submission type, topic, stance, political positions, sentiment, politeness, and toxicity** — using 231,042 comments from 36,384 threads on r/climate. (WIP: *[poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/discourse-cohesion.pdf) presented at IC2S2 2025*).
