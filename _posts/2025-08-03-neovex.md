As part of the [NEOVEX](https://neovex-projekt.de) research project, I collaborated with colleagues to develop **a graph-based dictionary expansion method** for detecting domain-specific unknown keywords, based on a fine-tuned GloVe model for targeted data collection. Together, we built an **eleven-year corpus** of conspiracy theoryâ€“related posts on the Great Replacement and New World Order from social media, legacy media, and alternative media via large-scale scraping and API integration. To detect conspiracy narratives, I **fine-tuned multiple BERT models** and **created  custom NLP methods** for this project, including entity recognition, dependency parsing, and both supervised and unsupervised text classification. This work supports large-scale analysis of conspiracy discourse across platforms, enabling deeper insights into misinformation dynamics and informing content moderation strategies.
