I inferred the early diffusion of the #FridaysForFuture based on 237,892 retweet sequences and the follower–following links of 51,803 participants. Using a top-down perspective, I examined how **networks, tweets, and retweet cascades** evolved, integrating both **actor dynamics** and **content patterns** to reveal how messages spread within and between communities in the movement’s formative stages.
